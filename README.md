# BPTTTutorial
This MATLAB program implements the complete BPTT process for GRU. We provide two algorithms here, a direct but quadratic time algorithm for easy understanding, and an optimized linear time algorithm.

Please see the [technical report](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341161236_A_Tutorial_On_Backward_Propagation_Through_Time_BPTT_In_The_Gated_Recurrent_Unit_GRU_RNN) for detailed derivation and explanation.
